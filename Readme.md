Educators play a crucial role in our development as people. Thus, it is very important to understand how we can help them and how we can equip them with the instruments they need in order for them to take care of our children. Their initial formative period, as professionals, doesn't always provide them with the knowledge they need in order to manage the socio-emotional aspects of teching children and teens. 

Teacher Brain Fitness is our solution to this problem. It is an application designed to provide short lessons, on subjects that cover a wide spectrum of subjects, such as:
* identifying children who have difficulties learning
* managing difficult situations inside the classroom
* helping children with special needs integrate in the group of students

These lessons are meant to teach good practices and guide educations through situations that they might have trouble dealing with.
